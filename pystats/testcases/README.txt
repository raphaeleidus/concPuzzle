There are 3 test cases in testcases/part1/: testcase1, testcase2, testcase3.
There are 2 output files. The first output file, output1.txt ignores keyword occurrences in 
single-line comments (i.e, //), multi-lien comments (i.e., /* ... */) and string literals.
The second output file, output2.txt ignores keyword occurrences in single-line comments and 
multi-line comments only. Both outputs are correct.

Let me know if you see any problems.
