/*
 
 * Generic Concurrent puzzle solver. 
 * Field puzzle holds the concrete puzzle.
 * Field seen contains the positions seen so far.

*/

/*
 * 
 * Essentially, the solver performs a depth-first search over the search space.
 * Method solve() starts the search by initializing the list of nodes with a 
 * node that contains the initial position, and a null previous node.
 * Method search(Node) examines the current node. If seen contains the 
 * position of the node, search returns a null list (i.e., the search 
 * stops at this branch). Otherwise, the search examines if the puzzle 
 * has reached the goal position, in which case it returns the solution in 
 * the form of a list of positions. If the puzzle has not reached the goal 
 * position yet, the search continues trying out each legal position that 
 * is a descendant of the current one.
